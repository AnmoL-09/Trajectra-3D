# Trajectra 3D

A 3D pathfinding visualization tool inspired by Micromouse robotics competitions. This project demonstrates various maze generation and pathfinding algorithms in an interactive 3D environment using Three.js.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project was developed as an experiment to visually demonstrate how pathfinding robots operate. Inspired by my experience with the Micromouse robotics competition, I needed a robust maze generator. To enhance both the challenge and the visual appeal, I chose to render everything in 3D using Three.js, which made the process smoother than expected.

## üìö Pathfinding Algorithms

### A* Algorithm
Widely regarded as one of the most effective and popular pathfinding methods, A* is known for its completeness, optimality, and efficiency. It uses weights and always finds the shortest route.

### Depth First Search
Originating from 19th-century research by Charles Pierre Tr√©maux, this strategy is often used for maze solving. It does not use weights and does not guarantee the shortest path.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
Conceived by Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956, this classic algorithm is a staple in pathfinding. It is weighted and ensures the shortest path is found.

### Greedy Best First Search
Unlike A*, this approach only considers the estimated distance to the goal, ignoring the start node. It is weighted but does not guarantee the shortest route.

## üèóÔ∏è Maze Generation Algorithms

### Recursive Division
This algorithm treats the maze as a fractal, starting with an empty grid and progressively adding walls. The result is a visually striking maze, with each step introducing more intricate detail.

### Depth First Search
Known for its speed and simplicity, this method creates mazes with long corridors and few branches by exploring as far as possible before backtracking.

### Kruskal's Algorithm
Used to generate minimal spanning trees, Kruskal's method produces mazes with regular, easily solvable patterns due to the equal weighting of all walls.

### Prim's Algorithm
Unlike Kruskal's, Prim's algorithm begins at a single point and expands outward, gradually building the maze from the inside out.
